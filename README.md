üß† AI Projects Collection

Welcome to my AI Projects Collection! This repository contains a set of practice projects and experiments exploring the capabilities of modern AI technologies. Each project is built as part of my learning journey with natural language processing and large language models (LLMs), with a focus on hands-on implementation and experimentation.
Currently, the repository includes:

üîç 1. RAG Document Reader

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based system that allows users to ask questions from custom documents. It combines semantic search with LLMs to give accurate, contextual answers from the source material.

Key Features:

    Supports PDF/Plain Text uploads

    Embedding-based document search

    LLM-powered Q&A interface

üìß 2. Cold Email Generator

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based system designed to streamline sales outreach by analysing the career pages of potential clients and generating personalised cold emails for business and sales executives.

Key Features:

    Crawls and analyses job listings from client websites (e.g., Nike, Adidas, Bosch)

    Extracts and identifies required skill sets from job postings

    Matches job requirements with available candidate profiles

    Generates tailored cold emails using LLMs to improve personalisation

    Enhances lead targeting and improves conversion rates through relevance-driven outreach

üîÄ 3. Multi AI Agent RAG with LangGraph & AstraDB

A multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system leveraging LangGraph and AstraDB to route and answer user queries intelligently. The system uses a router node to decide whether to perform a Wikipedia search or query a vector database populated with content from various websites.

Key Features:

    Router-based query handling using LangGraph

    Wikipedia and vector database (AstraDB) search nodes

    Embedding-based retrieval from web-sourced documents

    Task-specific prompting with LLM for contextual responses
